    JupyterHub brings the power of notebooks to groups of users. It gives users access to
    computational environments and resources without burdening the users with installation and
    maintenance tasks. Users - including students, researchers, and data scientists - can
    get their work done in their own workspaces on shared resources which can be managed
    efficiently by system administrators.

    JupyterHub runs in the cloud or on your own hardware, and makes it possible to serve
    a pre-configured data science environment to any user in the world. It is customizable
    and scalable, and is suitable for small and large teams, academic courses, and large-scale
    infrastructure.
