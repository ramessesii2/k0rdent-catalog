    ArangoDB combines the analytical power of native graphs with an integrated search engine,
    JSON support, and a variety of data access patterns via a single, composable query language.

    ArangoDB is available in a community and a commercial edition. You can use it for on-premises
    deployments, as well as a fully managed cloud service, the ArangoGraph Insights Platform.
