  Enterprise-grade Kubernetes Ingress Controller built on NGINX and NGINX Plus, designed for
  advanced traffic management in dynamic cloud-native environments.

  The F5 NGINX Ingress Controller integrates seamlessly with Kubernetes, allowing configuration
  through native Kubernetes resources. It supports standard Ingress functionality including
  content-based routing and TLS/SSL termination, with additional NGINX-specific features exposed
  via annotations and ConfigMaps.

  Key capabilities include:

   -	Load balancing for WebSocket, gRPC, TCP, and UDP applications
   -	Support for VirtualServer and VirtualServerRoute CRDs for fine-grained traffic control and traffic splitting
   -	TransportServer resource for managing TCP/UDP and TLS Passthrough load balancing
   -	Enhanced observability, security, and resilience when deployed with NGINX Plus

  Ideal for use cases requiring sophisticated routing, protocol-level control, and enterprise support.
