  Harness Delegate is a lightweight service that runs in your Kubernetes cluster and securely connects
  your internal infrastructure to the Harness SaaS platform. It performs all deployment and integration
  tasks triggered by Harness pipelines, without requiring any inbound access.

  This Helm chart installs the delegate with outbound-only connectivity, making it suitable for secure,
  production-grade environments.

  Key features:

  - Executes CI/CD workflows inside your cluster
  - Connects to artifacts, cloud, and verification tools
  - Supports auto-upgrades and fault recovery
  - Ideal for multi-cluster setups managed by k0rdent
