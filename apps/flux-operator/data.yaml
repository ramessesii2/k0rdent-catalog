  [Flux](https://fluxcd.io) is a leading GitOps Continuous Delivery tool
  used to streamline and automate application deployments on Kubernetes.
  Flux enables teams to achieve a reliable and auditable delivery process
  while promoting collaboration and traceability across different environments.

  Flux is powered by the GitOps Toolkit, a set of composable APIs and
  specialized tools that enable a wide range of continuous delivery use-cases,
  from simple Kubernetes deployment pipelines to multi-tenant and multi-cluster
  progressive delivery rollouts.

  For more information about the CNCF-graduated Flux project, please see
  the [Flux architecture overview](https://fluxcd.control-plane.io/guides/flux-architecture/).

  ### Operator Capabilities

  The [Flux Operator](https://github.com/controlplaneio-fluxcd/flux-operator) provides a
  declarative API for the installation, configuration and upgrade of CNCF Flux
  and the ControlPlane [enterprise distribution](https://fluxcd.control-plane.io/).

  The operator allows the configuration of Flux multi-tenancy lockdown, network policies,
  persistent storage, sharding, vertical scaling, custom patches, and the synchronization
  of the cluster state from Git repositories, OCI artifacts and S3-compatible storage.

  The Flux Operator supervises the Flux controllers and provides a unified view
  of all the Flux resources that define the GitOps workflows for the target cluster.
  The operator generates reports, emits events, and exports Prometheus metrics
  to help with monitoring and troubleshooting Flux.

  ### Operator Features

  The operator extends Flux with self-service capabilities, deployment windows,
  and preview environments for GitHub, GitLab and Azure DevOps pull requests testing.

  The operator ResourceSet API enables platform teams to define their own application standard
  as a group of Flux and Kubernetes resources that can be templated, parameterized and deployed
  as a single unit on self-service environments. For more information, please see the
  [ResourceSet documentation](https://fluxcd.control-plane.io/operator/resourcesets/introduction/).
