  For developers, who are building real-time data-driven applications, Redis is the preferred,
  fastest, and most feature-rich cache, data structure server, and document and vector query engine.

  #### Key use cases

  Redis excels in various applications, including:

  - **Caching:** Supports multiple eviction policies, key expiration, and hash-field expiration.
  - **Distributed Session Store:** Offers flexible session data modeling (string, JSON, hash).
  - **Data Structure Server:** Provides low-level data structures (strings, lists, sets, hashes, sorted sets, JSON, etc.) with high-level semantics (counters, queues, leaderboards, rate limiters) and supports transactions & scripting.
  - **NoSQL Data Store:** Key-value, document, and time series data storage.
  - **Search and Query Engine:** Indexing for hash/JSON documents, supporting vector search, full-text search, geospatial queries, ranking, and aggregations via Redis Query Engine.
  - **Event Store & Message Broker:** Implements queues (lists), priority queues (sorted sets), event deduplication (sets), streams, and pub/sub with probabilistic stream processing capabilities.
  - **Vector Store for GenAI:** Integrates with AI applications (e.g. LangGraph, mem0) for short-term memory, long-term memory, LLM response caching (semantic caching), and retrieval augmented generation (RAG).
  - **Real-Time Analytics:** Powers personalization, recommendations, fraud detection, and risk assessment.
