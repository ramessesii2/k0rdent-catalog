  Ampere Altra-based platforms are now supported for use with k0rdent child clusters.
  These ARM64-based systems are optimized for highly efficient, scalable computing and are
  ideal for edge, telecom, and AI-driven workloads.

  Ampere’s architectural design enables running k0rdent child clusters in environments with
  power or thermal constraints—such as edge data centers, mobile base stations, or
  embedded applications—without sacrificing performance or orchestration capabilities.

  Whether deploying traditional Kubernetes services or advanced AI-enhanced applications,
  Ampere’s balance of performance-per-watt and deterministic behavior makes it a solid
  platform for production-grade, multi-cluster k0rdent workloads.
